# jitter_live_api_c: A CPM package implementing the jitter realtime protocol on top of MQTT

The goal is to provide a client for the jitter realtime protocol, which is basically MQTT with a few
standard topic + topic types. The code is written to be nonblocking and very flexible plain-c (targeted at embedded systems).
